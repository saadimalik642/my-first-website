# My First Website

Welcome to my first website project! 🚀

This project is part of my journey in learning HTML and CSS. It includes:

- A basic homepage created with HTML
- Styling with CSS to make the site visually appealing

## 📂 Files Included

- `index.html` — The main HTML file
- `style.css` — The CSS file used for styling

## 📖 What I Learned

- HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, images, links)
- CSS styling (colors, fonts, hover effects, layout)
- How to use GitHub to upload and share projects

## 🌐 Live Website

(Coming Soon – Will be added after GitHub Pages is set up)

## 🙌 Thanks for Visiting!
